# High Five Twtich!

# Requriements:
1. Script editor (I use Atom editor)

# Directions:
1. Download the github repo
2. Open up favorite script editor (i.e Atom editor) and edit index.html & script.js under js folder and change in script.js: "jae1379" to your channel name (ie jae1379), and change "YOUR CUSTOM REWARD ID" to your custom reward ID as found with instafluff's amazing reward ID finder (& go support him!) https://github.com/instafluff/TwitchCustomRewardID; SAVE!
7. Add browser soure on OBS --> local file --> index.html
8. Add chroma key filter to green and adjust so that it's chroma-keying just right (too much will be no show, too little will not work). 
    8.1 (my settings are Similiarity 375, smooth 60, and leave the rest the same as default) 
9. Done! Any questions? Come hang out twitch.tv/jae1379 :D

 # Future fix:
 Would like to not use mp4 file with but use webm file with alpha channel, and would like to make this repo hosted on github + script changes so that anyone can use without personally changing script!
